# What is Markdown for?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to **format text** in a simple and quick way.  
Its main advantage is that it doesn’t require complex programs; with just a few symbols, you can structure clear and well-presented documents.  

## Main Uses
- Create project documentation.  
- Write README files on platforms like GitHub.  
- Take organized notes in apps like Obsidian or Notion.  
- Publish formatted articles or blog posts.  
- Style messages in forums and chats that support Markdown.  

## Quick Example
- **Bold:** `**text**` → **text**  
- *Italic:* `*text*` → *text*
